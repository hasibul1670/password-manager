## üîí Authentication Flow

### 1. **JWT Authentication**:
   - **Access Token**: A short-lived token used for securing user actions.
   - **Refresh Token**: A longer-lived token used to obtain a new access token once expired.

### 2. **Cookie-Based Authentication**:
   - Login credentials are stored securely in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks.
   - Cookies maintain user sessions in a secure manner.

### 3. **OTP-Based Authentication**:
   - After initial login, an OTP is sent to the user's registered email for additional verification.
   - OTP expires after a short period to ensure maximum security.

### 4. **Password Hashing**:
   - User passwords are hashed before being stored to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.
